# ðŸš€ BERT-Based Fake News Detection

A deep learning approach to automatically detect fake news using fine-tuned BERT transformer models. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning for misinformation detection tasks.


Overview

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model for binary classification of news articles as either "fake" or "real". The model achieved impressive performance with **99.2% accuracy** on the test set, demonstrating the power of transformer architectures for natural language understanding tasks.

Why BERT for Fake News Detection?

- Bidirectional Context**: BERT processes text bidirectionally, capturing context from both directions
- Pre-trained Representations**: Leverages knowledge from large-scale language modeling
- Transfer Learning**: Adapts general language understanding to specific classification tasks
- Attention Mechanisms**: Identifies important linguistic patterns that distinguish fake from real news
